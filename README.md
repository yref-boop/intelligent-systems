# intelligent-systems
practicum of intelligent systems

this prroject is divided in two parts, on the first we implement a symbolic intelligent system, on the second a sub-symbolic

### p1 - symbolic ai
an intelligent system that aims to complete a partial magic square, several algorithms are tested (depth/breadth first, A*...) and compared

### p2 - sub-symbolic ai
a neural network is "implemented" on matlab, the database used has been obtained from a series of aerodynamic and acoustic tests of two and three-dimensional airfoil blade sections conducted in an anechoic wind tunnel, this data aims to be able to predict the sound given some parameters as input
the goal of the practical is to study and understand the neural networks that would be able to solve this problem using matlab, check how the change of architecture of the neural network affects the efficiency and result overall
