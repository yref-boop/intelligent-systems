PROBLEM: a NxN magic square is a matrix that containss the numbers between 1 and NxN 
arranged so that the sum of the elements of each row, or colum or diagonals, is always:
\frac{N(NxN+1)}{2}

Formalize the problem so that it can be solved using search strategies
Use simple actions that only change a single cell of the square

INITIAL STATE:
    {aa,ba,ca,da,....,na}
    {. .                }
    {.     .            }
    {.        .         }
    {.            .     }
    {a.............., nn}
    
    a matrix of integers, initialized to 0 except the given data

SET OF ACTIONS:
    Add number (x) to position (y,z)

    PRECONDITIONS:
        the previous number on position x is not 0  
        the number x is not bigger than nxn
        and is not repeated

TRANSITION MODEL:
    

GOAL TEST:
    sum of columns & sum of rows & sum of diagonal == wanted number

POSSIBLE FUTURE HEURISTICS:
    symmetric matrix
    no repeated values
    go in order
    first highest then lowest???
