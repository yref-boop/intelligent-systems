# intelligent-systems
practicum of intelligent systems

this prroject is divided in two parts, on the first we implement a symbolic intelligent system, on the second a sub-symbolic

#### p1 - symbolic ai
an intelligent system that aims to complete a partial magic square, several algorithms are tested (depth/breadth first, A*...) and compared

#### p2 - sub-symbolic ai
a neural network is "implemented" on matlab, a database predicting solar flares is to be used
the original problem predicted how many solar flares of each type will occur in the next 24 hours, it is outside the scope of intelligent systems, thus, we simplify to a recursion problem that estimates the number of solar flares, regardless of the type
